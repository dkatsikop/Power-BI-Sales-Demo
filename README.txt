First, we download the Sales file from the link below:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/beekiran/sales-data-analysis

Once downloaded, we create a local folder where we will save the files of our project. 

The main task is to show the top 5 products that made the biggest number of ordered quantities, per city, in 2019.

In the Home tab, click get data and choose “Text/CSV”
Choose Transform Data
Once we navigate over the data, we choose “close & apply”

Then on the Visualizations, we choose the Map and from the fields,
we drag & drop in the Location the “City”, in the Legend the “Product” and in size the “Quantity Ordered”. 
In the Filters, we choose the field “Product”, choose the filter type “Top N”, show items as Top 5 and by value “Quantity Ordered”.  The order date – year is 2019 checked.

We drag & drop from the Visualizations the Table, and from the fields, we drag & drop in the Values the “City”, “Quantity Ordered”. 
In the filter, we add the Product, we choose from the filter type “Top N”, show items Top 5 and by value we add “Quantity Ordered”.  
Click on the “apply filter” and the table shows the relevant results. The order date – year is 2019 checked.

Finally, we drag & drop from the Visualizations the Matrix, we drag & drop in the Rows the “City” & “Product” and in the values the “Quantity Ordered”. 
In the filter, we add the Product, we choose from the filter type “Top N”, show items Top 5 and by value we add “Quantity Ordered”.
